In this project, I analyzed and explored dataset with SQL using Postgresql Server and Microsoft Excel. I wrangled the data to find insights and patterns like the total profit made by BuyBuy in Q2 of every year from 2011 to 2016. As the Data Analyst, I was directed by the CMO of Amazing Buy-Buy company, a fictitious manufacturing company to analyze the sales data of the company . He wants to improve the product offerings to the company's customers

## Steps Taken to Provide Answers to the above Questions 

1. I was provided an excel CSV file which I imported to Pgadmin environment after creating a table with the same columns and data type as the excel file in pgadmin.

2. Then I exported the output of some queries as csv files, summarized the tables using pivot table and then visualized using the relevant pivot charts.

## Excel Dashboard Report
Here is the Dashboard report that i built using Microsoft Excel to further visualize the insights and trends derived from the analysis.
